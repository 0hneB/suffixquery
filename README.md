SuffixQuery - KML Place Name Extractor
SuffixQuery is a standalone GUI application that allows users to extract place names from OpenStreetMap data using the Overpass API. With this tool, you can specify a country, place types (like town, city, village), and a suffix (e.g. "ach") to find all matching locations and export them to a .kml file for use in mapping applications.

💡 Features
✅ Filter places by type (village, town, city, road)

✅ Generate .kml files in the format country--suffix.kml

✅ Automatically saves the KML file in the application's directory

🖥️ How to Use
Download and extract the application folder.

Select a country, enter a suffix (e.g., ach), choose place types (town, village, etc.), and click Fetch Data.

The KML file will be saved in the same folder with the format country--suffix.kml.

🗺️ Example Use Case
Want to find all towns and villages in Germany ending in "ach"?
→ Just choose "Germany", enter "ach", select "town" and "village", check suffix and hit Fetch Data.
You’ll get a germany--ach.kml file with all matching places.
